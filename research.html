		      <img src="images.new/calder2.jpg" 
			   alt="Type Ia SNe"><br> 

		      <a HREF="http://astro.sunysb.edu/acalder/"><b>Alan
			  Calder</b></a> studies a variety of
		      nuclear astrophysics problems as well as
		      the basic physical processes involved in
		      these problems. He has investigated core
		      collapse supernovae and coalescing
		      neutron stars, events thought to be
		      sites of r-process nucleosynthesis, and
		      problems involving thermonuclear
		      explosions, classical novae and
		      thermonuclear runaway (Type Ia)
		      supernovae in particular. Calder is also
		      interested in the challenging problem of
		      radiation hydrodynamics, which has
		      numerous applications in
		      astrophysics. His research involves
		      large-scale, multi-physics simulations
		      of astrophysical events, and he is very
		      interested in the validation of codes
		      and simulations by comparing simulations
		      to actual laboratory experiments.

		      The primary goal
		      of <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/koda/"><b>Jin
			  Koda's</b></a> research is to understand the
		      gas dynamical evolution of galactic disks,
		      with an emphasis on star formation and
		      interstellar medium (ISM) evolution. He
		      employs both observational and theoretical
		      approaches to explore gas structure,
		      dynamics, and star formation over galactic
		      disks.

		      Jin Koda uses numerical hydrodynamic
		      simulations and predicts the dramatic
		      evolution of ISM structures in galactic
		      dynamics (e.g. Wada & Koda 2004). The growth
		      of such structures triggers star formation,
		      controlling the formation and evolution of
		      galactic disks. He also observes the
		      evolutionary links among dynamics, ISM
		      structures, and star formation. Recent and
		      upcoming instruments are providing exciting
		      opportunities in resolving ISM structures
		      over global galactic disks. The figure shows
		      an example -- a new image of molecular gas
		      in the Whirlpool galaxy M51 observed with
		      the Combined Array for Research in
		      Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and Nobeyama
		      45m telescope (NRO45). This new map reveals
		      the ISM evolution driven by galactic
		      dynamics: strong shear motions on spiral
		      arms pull apart massive molecular gas
		      associations as they cross the spiral arms,
		      producing filamentary/spur structures in
		      interarm regions (Koda et al. 2009). He is
		      now leading the CARMA & NRO45 survey of
		      nearby galaxies to establish more general
		      picture of ISM evolution and star formation
		      in galaxies. He is also a member of the
		      Herschel key science project (KINGFISH --
		      Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a
		      Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel), which
		      will unveil the immediate sites of star
		      formation that are hidden deeply in the
		      dense ISM.

		    <h3>James Lattimer</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/symcornew.png" alt="NS properties"><br>

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/lattimer/"><b>Jim
			Lattimer</b></a> studies the structure,
			composition, formation and evolution of
			neutron stars by working at the crossroads
			between nuclear theory and astrophysics.  He
			also researches gravitational collapse
			supernovae, the mergers of neutron
			star-neutron star and neutron star-black hole
			binaries, and neutrino emission from
			proto-neutron stars.  He is interested in the
			nuclear matter equation of state and the
			constraints that can be placed on it by
			laboratory nuclear measurements as well as by
			pulsar-timing observations and optical and
			X-ray studies of neutron stars.  He has
			published, and continues to develop, tabulated
			equations of state that are frequently used
			throughout the world in large-scale
			computational simulations of supernovae and
			neutron star mergers.<br>

		        This figure shows the experimentally
		        constrained region of parameter space for
		        symmetry energy coefficients, showing
		        remarkable agreement with neutron matter
		        theory and astrophysical measurements from
		        neutron stars.  The nuclear constraints come
		        from nuclear binding energies, dipole
		        polarizabilities, giant dipole resonance
		        energies, and neutron skin thickenesses, and
		        from the composition of fragments in heavy ion
		        collisions.  The astrophysical measurements
		        come from neutron star X-ray bursts and from
		        thermal radiation from of recently-accreting
		        and now-cooling neutron stars in binary
		      systems.

		    <h3>Marilena Loverde</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/loverde.jpg" alt="Magnetar"><br>

		      <b><a href="http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~marilena/">Marilena
		      Loverde</a></b> is a theoretical astrophysicist
		      working in cosmology. Her primary interests are
		      developing tools to use astrophysical datasets
		      to learn about the fundamental physics of dark
		      matter, dark energy, and inflation and to learn
		      about the history and evolution of structure in
		      the universe. She has worked extensively on weak
		      gravitational lensing in galaxy surveys,
		      primordial non-Gaussianity as a test of
		      inflation, and massive neutrinos in cosmology
		      (Image credit: Springel et al. 2005).

		    <h3>Rosalba Perna</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/Magnetar-3b-400.png" alt="Magnetar"><br>

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/rosalba/"><b>Rosalba
			  Perna</b></a> is a theorist with eclectic
		      research interests, including gamma-ray
		      bursts, neutron stars, gravitational
		      lensing, accretion phenomenena, the growth
		      of supermassive black holes, foregrounds for
		      CMB experiments, axions, exoplanets.<br>

		      In the last few years, her research has
		      partly focused on using gamma-ray bursts as
		      cosmological tools, to probe the physical
		      conditions (i.e. metallicity, clumping, dust
		      content) in high-redshift galaxies, and to
		      put constraints on warm dark matter models
		      for structure formation.<br>

		      Another currently active line of research is
		      in the area of the so-called 'magnetars', a
		      class of neutron stars characterized by very
		      strong magnetic fields, on the order of
		      10<sup>14</sup>-10<sup>15</sup>G.  These are
		      the most intense fields ever measured in the
		      Universe.  As the magnetic field evolves in
		      the interior of these stars, magnetic
		      stresses can occasionally become strong
		      enough to break the crust, yielding
		      'starquakes', which trigger outbursts in
		      gamma and X-rays.  Rosalba's research aims
		      at understanding, by means of simulations of
		      the coupled thermal and magnetic field
		      evolution within the neutron star crust, the
		      role played by the magnetic field strength
		      and topology on the observed phenomenology
		      of these sources, and in particular on their
		      temperature and timing evolution, and on
		      their outburst statistics.<br>

		      <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/nsehgal/Site/Homepage.html"><b>Neelima
			  Sehgal's</b></a> research focuses on using
		      cosmological data to understand the nature
		      of dark energy and dark matter, the
		      properties of neutrinos, and the physics of
		      the early Universe, including inflation.
		      This is done primarily using measurements of
		      the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and
		      Stony Brook is actively involved in the
		      ACTPol Collaboration, which measures the CMB
		      from a ground-based telescope in the Atacama
		      Desert in Chile.  Neelima's group is primary
		      interested in exploiting the gravitational
		      lensing signal in the CMB to measure the
		      mass of neutrinos, and in measuring the
		      polarization signal in the CMB to look for
		      signatures of inflation.

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/msimon/plan.html"><b>Mike
			  Simon</b></a> is interested in the formation
		      of stars, brown dwarfs, and planets, and
		      more specifically in the processes and
		      circumstances that govern the formation of
		      binaries and higher order multiples.  At
		      present, he is most involved in using
		      dynamical methods to measure the masses of
		      young stars to measure the masses of very
		      young stars with high precision.  The goal
		      of this work is to calibrate calculations of
		      pre-main sequence evolution and thus to
		      improve the accuracy of mass and age
		      estimates of young stars from their location
		      in the HR diagram.  Increasingly, this work
		      is leading to similar studies of brown
		      dwarfs.

		      His research uses state-of-the-art
		      instrumentation in several areas of astronomy
		      (e.g. IR spectroscopy, adaptive optics imaging,
		      and interferometry at Gemini and Keck
		      Observatories, mm-wave interferometry at IRAM
		      and ALMA).  This research is almost always
		      collaborative and offers students the
		      opportunity to work with instruments at the
		      forefront of modern astronomy and with
		      scientists who are expert in their use.</span>

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/dswesty/"><b>Doug
			  Swesty</b></a> is interested in a variety of
		      nuclear astrophysical and
		      radiation-hydrodynamic phenomena.  He is
		      working on neutrino radiation-hydrodynamic
		      models of stellar core-collapse and type II
		      supernova explosions.  This work utilizes
		      large-scale parallel computers to carry out
		      high-resolution models of the
		      neutrino-radiating fluid that is present in
		      proto-neutron stars formed at the endpoint
		      of the collapse of a massive stellar core.<br>

		      His research also focuses on the role of the
		      equation of state of hot, dense matter in
		      facilitating the supernova explosion
		      associated with the stellar core collapse.
		      Swesty also actively works with colleagues
		      at national laboratories, such as Lawrence
		      Livermore National Laboratory, on the
		      development of new radiation transport and
		      radiation-hydrodynamic algorithms and codes.
		      This includes the development of
		      verification tests as well as validation
		      testing strategies using data from high
		      energy density laboratory experiments.

		      <a href="http://www.astro.sunysb.edu/anja/">
		      <b>Anja von der Linden</b></a> uses observations 
                        of galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally 
                        bound objects in the Universe, to help answer 
                        fundamental questions about our Universe:  What 
                        is it made of?  What are dark matter and dark 
                        energy?  How do galaxies evolve?  She specializes 
                        in using weak gravitational lensing to accurately 
                        calibrate cluster mass measurements, a crucial step 
                        in using clusters as cosmological probes.  Her 
                        <i>Weighing the Giants</i> 
                        project enabled the highest precision cosmology

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/fwalter/"><b>Fred
			  Walter</b></a> has eclectic interests in
		      galactic astronomy.  His main interests are
		      in star formation in the Galaxy, stellar
		      coronae and chromospheres, and compact

		    <h3>Michael Zingale</h3>
		    <span>
		      <img src="images.new/wdconvect_1.5rot_enuc_med.gif"
			   alt="white dwarf convection"><br>

		      <a href="http://astro.sunysb.edu/mzingale/"><b>Mike
			  Zingale</b></a> is interested in
		      computational and nuclear astrophysics, in
		      particular the development of computational
		      methods appropriate to modeling Type Ia
		      supernovae, Type I X-ray bursts, and
		      Classical novae.  Type Ia supernovae are the
		      largest thermonuclear explosions in the
		      Universe.  The physical processes leading up
		      to the explosion involve a wide range of
		      length and timescales, making these events
		      extremely challenging to simulate.  Working
		      with colleagues at LBL, Zingale has
		      developed a low Mach number hydrodynamic
		      code, <a href="http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Maestro/">Maestro</a>,
		      appropriate to the conditions in these
		      explosions.  Maestro filters soundwaves from
		      the system, allowing for the efficient
		      simulation of long timescale processes, such
		      as astrophysical convection.  This method
		      was recently used
		      to <a href="/mzingale/wdconvect/">model the
			final hours of 'smoldering'</a> preceding
		      the explosion of a Type Ia supernovae.  This
		      type of calculation is critical to
		      determining the distribution of the initial
		      flames for the subsequent explosion.
		      Current applications include the convection
		      in <a href="../mzingale/subchandra/">sub-Chandra
			models of SNe Ia</a> and X-ray bursts.
		      Maestro is freely available for use.<br>


		      Together with other members of the nuclear
		      astrophysics group, Zingale is also
		      interested in verification and validation of
		      astrophysical hydrodynamics and radiation
		      hydrodynamics codes.
